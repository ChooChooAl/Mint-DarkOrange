# Mint-DarkOrange Desktop Theme.
A dark orange theme, larger fonts, more contrast, and less spacing between lines in lists (nemo and menu).

Has a wooden wallpaper for background.  
Currently I'm using this on Linux Mint 22 Cinnamon. 
The icon theme used, does not come with this desktop theme. I have a repository for an AKicons icon theme that is very close.

This desktop theme does have a gnome-shell folder if you want to use it in Gnome.  I can't say it's perfect, I wanted something for Zorin OS 17, so I did a quick construction for my needs.

I am constantly tweaking this theme as it seems to be my main bread & butter theme.
